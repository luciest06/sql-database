# Project overview

We are a company that owns rental bikes and would like to be able to anticipate high demands to make sure to have enough bikes to be rented.
We need to identify peak times and weather conditions when the most bikes are rented out.


# Questions 

Hypothesis 1 : Rental-rate is the highest during summer season.
Hypothesis 2 : No matter the weather, there is minimal impact on registered bike users’ behavior.

# Dataset & Trello

- Scope for sales : 2011 - 2012
- https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/275/bike+sharing+dataset 

- Trello : https://trello.com/b/paH3IE6a/ironhack-week4-sql


## Main challenges

Loading the dataset into MySQL

→ importing the csv-file, but also matching everything concerning the creation of tables and the proper insertion of the content
→ dealing with error messages (also referring to foreign key constraints)

Understanding the data we are working with und formulating fitting hypotheses

Making sure classification provided in the data set is consistent

Importing SQL into Jupyter Lab 


# Conclusions
First hypothesis was confirmed while second one wasn't.

# Next steps
Making sure bike availability is assured during peak seasons
